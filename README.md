Thurgood Watson's Python Security Portfolio
Hey there! üëã I'm Thurgood Watson, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and Python developer. Welcome to my project portfolio, where I showcase my journey through network security, data analysis, and Python development. These projects represent real-world solutions I've built to address common challenges in IT security.
What You'll Find Here
1. üîí Password Strength Analyzer
Ever wondered how secure your passwords really are? I built this tool to help answer that question. It goes beyond basic password requirements to provide detailed security insights and actionable recommendations.
What It Does:

Evaluates password complexity using multiple criteria
Provides specific feedback on how to strengthen weak passwords
Implements industry-standard security practices

Technical Highlights:

Advanced string manipulation techniques
Custom scoring algorithms
User-friendly feedback system

2. üîç Network Port Scanner
After learning about network vulnerabilities in my security studies, I developed this scanner to help identify potential security gaps in network configurations.
What It Does:

Performs comprehensive port scanning across specified IP ranges
Identifies open ports and potential security risks
Generates detailed reports of findings

Technical Highlights:

Socket programming
Multi-threaded scanning capabilities
TCP/UDP protocol handling

3. üìä Network Traffic Analyzer
As someone fascinated by network behavior patterns, I created this analyzer to help understand and visualize network traffic in real-time.
What It Does:

Captures and analyzes network packets
Identifies unusual traffic patterns
Provides detailed protocol analysis
Generates usage statistics and visualizations

Technical Highlights:

Packet capture and processing
Statistical analysis
Real-time data visualization
Protocol-level traffic inspection
